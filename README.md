Our website begins with asking the user to either login with a Google account or a non-google account. 
This then redirects to the home page in which the user has options to view the forum, create a profile, or input an exercise.
To create a profile, the user must include a bio, a profile picture (one is given as default if they choose not to), and their date of birth. 
In the forum, the user can view and like other user's posts as well as create their own. 
If a user inputs certain numbers of exercises, they will be rewarded with a bronze, silver, and gold trophy which appears on their profile page. 
The user can also view the "Bangerz" tab which redirects to a page with our favorite artist of the month's tracks acquired from Spotify.
